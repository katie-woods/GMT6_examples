Bash scripts are written for GMT 6.0.0. Katie Woods
Scripts run on SGEES018 configuration: 02 Aug 2022

Scripts are in main GMT6_examples directory (/Volumes/GeoPhysics_16/users-data/woodskath/GMT6_examples/) 
and can be run from command line with:
$ ./plot_NZ_inset.sh

DIRECTORIES:
colour_palettes/	.cpt files for plotting topography etc
data_examples/		data used in the examples
figures/			where output figures go (set on 'gmt begin' line in scripts)
files/				topography files etc

Figure output extension is set on 'gmt begin' line.
Usually I output in .pdf (preserves transparency features) and add extra 
annotions/convert to desired format using Inkscape.
